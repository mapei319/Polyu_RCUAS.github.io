Unmanned autonomous systems (UASs), including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) are revolutionizing human society by alleviating the stress arising from the global trend of aging populations. Many countries and regions have developed policies for the critical strategic development of UASs. Hong Kong, Mainland China, and the rest of the world are undergoing a revolution arising from “Smart City” technologies. 

For years, many UAS studies have been conducted by the PolyU. Several important research institutes (e.g., RISUD, SCRI and RIAM) was established to support research and development related to these new technologies. Research Centre of Unmanned Autonomous Systems (RCUAS) coordinates PolyU’s UAS researches and developments among different faculties/departments or institutes/centers, and facilitates PolyU’s internal and external collaboration with leading partners. RCUAS also plays an important role by providing physical UAS research and development platforms to synergize the impactful researches conducted in PolyU, exemplifying our motto, to learn and to apply, for the benefit of mankind (開物成務 勵學利民). The ultimate goal is to collaboratively increase society-oriented research that will have a positive impact on Hong Kong, the Greater Bay Area, and the Asia-Pacific region.
